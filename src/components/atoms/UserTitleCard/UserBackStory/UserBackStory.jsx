        Back in 2014, my passion for computers was ignited by my fascination
        with their ability to solve complex problems and create remarkable
        experiences. This curiosity led me to pursue a BE in Computer Science
        from SDIT in Mangalore, where I embarked on my journey into the world of
        software development.

        Over the years, I have evolved by working on a diverse range of
        projects. My career began in game development at Juego Studios, where I
        designed and developed scalable server applications for multiplayer
        games and real-time applications. Notable projects included creating
        NodeJS-based games like Kalutai and Earth Arena, as well as implementing
        a serverless poker engine. This experience provided me with a deep
        understanding of game logic and real-time data handling.

        Transitioning into web development, I joined Capillary Technologies,
        where I have been instrumental in improving development efficiency and
        implementing dynamic micro-frontends using React. My role also involves
        optimizing system performance and mentoring team members to ensure
        high-quality project delivery. Additionally, I have worked on numerous
        Proof of Concepts (POCs) and conducted extensive research and
        development (R&D) to explore innovative solutions and stay ahead of
        technological advancements.

        Beyond my professional work, I have a strong interest in open-source
        contributions and competitive programming. These activities allow me to
        continuously refine my coding skills and stay updated with the latest
        technologies. Outside of the tech world, I enjoy playing football,
        engaging in competitive programming, playing CS:GO, and traveling to
        explore new places and cultures. I also cherish spending time with my
        family.
